- 👋 Hi, I’m @mjoriatti

- 👀 I’m interested in science and technology when not travelling, hearing some music, reading or
playing random games like [trator's empire](https://mgcl.co/traitors?_m=MhZRhZdSfcK-&fbclid=IwAR2FXCo1RIc-xUDKyqN2yWmeOCbTH419pX4-DvAU6BN7AEK1GJAquc0EIwA)...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use github ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

- 💞️ I’m involved in the community [La Riposte](https://www.lariposte.org/) and looking to collaborate with several of my comrades.

- 📫 You can reach me with [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/manuel.joriatti) or [linked-in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjoriatti) in-mail, but don't expect a timely answer as I'm not always connected and my current employment fulfills my needs and expectations.
