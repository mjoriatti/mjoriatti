- 👋 Hi, I’m @mjoriatti
- 👀 I’m interested in science and technology when not travelling, biking, reading or playing random games like "trator's empire"...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use github ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- 💞️ I’m involved in the community La Riposte and looking to collaborate with several of my comrades.
- 📫 You can reach me by mail mjoriatti at orange dot fr or with linked-in in-mail (but don't expect a timely answer as my current employment fulfills my needs and expectations).
